Questions
---------

Q: Why is GNATCOLL.JSON included in this library?
A: To avoid writing up a JSON implementation by myself.

Q: I'm getting error that gnatcoll-json.ads is provided by several projects!
A: Your project depends on parts of GNATCOLL not indirectly provided by libesl.
   Remove the "src/external" from the .gpr file and instead put 
   with "gnatcoll";
   in the header.
